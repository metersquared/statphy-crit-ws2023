HW 6 by Fabio Steyer, Arya Prasetya

Problem 12:

Create and open virtual environment:
`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`

Install the required packages by using the requirement.txt:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To generate calculation of Monte Carlo simulations use the hw06_ising.py script. It uses an argument sparser, so you can choose which temperature bounds and L you want to have :
`python3 hw06_ising.py [L] [Tmin] [Tmax]`
i.e. `python3 hw06_ising.py 8 1.5 3.0`

This will return a CSV file, "Monte_Carlo_Ising_Importance_L[L].csv".

To generate plot of mean squared magnetization per volume over temperature run:
`python3 hw06_plot.py`
