HW 2 by Fabio Steyer, Arya Prasetya

Problem 3:

the code is in form of a jupyter notebook

for executing the code run all cells of the notebook (.ipynb) starting vom top to buttom

all tasks are marked with headlines above

Problem 4:

Create and open virtual environment:
`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`

Install the required packages by using the requirement.txt:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To generate images of random walk (nonreversal walk trial 4a) and 5 selfavoiding walks 4c)):
`python3 random_walk.py`

Note on the nonreversal random walk, we can see the slope increased, due to the fact that walks will propagate further with nonreversal condition.

To generate plot of mean squared distance of nonreversal walk:
`python3 msq_nonreversal.py`
