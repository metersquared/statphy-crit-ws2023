HW 7 by Fabio Steyer, Arya Prasetya

Problem 13:

Create and open virtual environment:
`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`

Install the required packages by using the requirement.txt:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To generate calculation of Monte Carlo simulations use the hw07_fs_scaling.py script. It uses an argument sparser, so you can choose which temperature bounds and L you want to have :
`python3 hw07_fs_scaling.py [L]`
i.e. `python3 hw07_fs_scaling.py 10`

This will return a CSV file, "Monte_Carlo_Ising_Importance\_\_FS_Scaling_L[L].csv".

To generate plot of mean magnetization per volume over temperature run:
`python3 hw07_plot.py`

From out calculation, we get that beta=0.099 which is close to the expected value of beta=1/8 for d=2.
